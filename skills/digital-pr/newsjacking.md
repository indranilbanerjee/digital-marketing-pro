# Newsjacking — Rapid Response Framework

## Relevance Scoring

Before newsjacking, score the opportunity:

| Criteria | Score (1-5) | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Brand relevance** | | Does this topic connect to our expertise? |
| **Audience interest** | | Does our audience care about this topic? |
| **Unique value add** | | Can we add data, expert insight, or unique perspective? |
| **Brand safety** | | Is it safe to associate our brand with this topic? |
| **Timeliness** | | Can we respond fast enough to be relevant? |

**Total score 20+**: Go. **15-19**: Proceed with caution. **Below 15**: Skip.

- [ ] **Accurate**: All claims and data points are verified before publishing
