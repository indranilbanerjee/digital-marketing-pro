# Media Outreach — Methodology & Templates

## Journalist Research

1. **Identify relevant beats**: Match your story angle to journalists who cover that topic
2. **Study recent coverage**: Read their last 5-10 articles to understand angle preferences
3. **Check social media**: Follow them on Twitter/X for real-time interests and engagement style
4. **Verify contact info**: Use tools (Muck Rack, Prowly, Cision) or check publication bios
5. **Note preferences**: Many journalists state pitch preferences in their bios ("DM me" vs "email only")
