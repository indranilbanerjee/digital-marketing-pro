## Writing Guidelines

- **Inverted pyramid**: Most important information first
- **Objective tone**: Report facts, not marketing claims
- **No superlatives** without attribution: Instead of "leading," use "one of the fastest-growing"
- **Active voice**: "[Brand] launched" not "The new product was launched by [Brand]"
- **Readable**: Short paragraphs, clear language, no jargon
- **Quotable quotes**: Executive quotes should add insight that a journalist would actually include

### Good Quote Example
"We saw a 40% increase in AI-generated search traffic for our customers last year, which told us the market was ready for a dedicated optimization platform." — [CEO Name]

### Bad Quote Example
"We're thrilled to announce this exciting new product that we believe will revolutionize the industry." — [CEO Name]
