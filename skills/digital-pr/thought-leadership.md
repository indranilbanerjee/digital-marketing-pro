# Thought Leadership — Strategy & Execution

## Content Strategy

### Types of Thought Leadership Content

| Type | Description | Difficulty | Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Original research** | Proprietary data, surveys, analysis | High | Very High |
| **Contrarian takes** | Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence | Medium | High |
| **Frameworks** | Create new mental models for industry problems | Medium | High |
| **Predictions** | Data-backed industry forecasts | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Expert commentary** | Timely analysis of industry events | Low | Medium |
| **Case studies** | Deep analysis of what worked/failed | Medium | Medium |

### Content Creation Process
1. Identify 3-5 topics where the brand/executive has unique expertise
2. Audit existing thought leadership landscape (what's already been said)
3. Find the unique angle (proprietary data, contrarian view, new framework)
4. Create the content with credible evidence
5. Distribute through owned, earned, and paid channels
6. Repurpose across formats (article → presentation → video → social)

## Byline Placement Guide

### How to Get Published

1. **Research the outlet**: Read their contributor guidelines (many publish them)
2. **Study existing bylines**: What topics, length, format, tone do they publish?
3. **Pitch the topic, not the article**: Send a 2-3 sentence pitch, not a complete draft
4. **Offer exclusivity**: One outlet at a time for the same piece
5. **Follow their editorial guidelines** exactly (word count, format, no promotional content)

### Top Outlets for Bylines by Industry
- **Tech**: TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Next Web, Wired
- **Marketing**: HBR, MarketingProfs, Content Marketing Institute, Adweek
- **Business**: Forbes (contributor network), Entrepreneur, Inc., Fast Company
- **Finance**: Financial Times, Bloomberg, American Banker
- **Industry-specific**: Trade publications in every vertical

### Rules
- Never make the byline promotional (focus on industry insights)
- Author must be a real expert with verifiable credentials
- Include data and specific examples (not generic advice)
- Respond to editor feedback quickly and graciously
