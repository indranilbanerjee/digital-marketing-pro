## Account Structure Best Practices

### Modern Simplified Structure (Recommended)
```
Account
├── Brand Search Campaign
│   └── 1–3 ad groups (brand, brand + product, brand + competitor)
├── Non-Brand Search Campaign(s)
│   └── Themed ad groups by service/product category
├── Performance Max Campaign(s)
│   └── Asset groups segmented by product/service line
├── Retargeting Campaign
│   └── Display/YouTube remarketing
└── Video/Demand Gen Campaign
    └── Top/mid-funnel awareness
```

### Structure Principles
- [ ] Consolidate campaigns to feed algorithm more data per campaign
- [ ] Minimum 30 conversions per campaign per month for automated bidding
- [ ] Avoid single-keyword ad groups (SKAGs) — outdated with broad match + smart bidding
- [ ] Segment by budget priority, not granular keyword themes
- [ ] Use labels and naming conventions for reporting clarity

## Bidding Strategy Decision Tree

```
START: What is your primary objective?
│
├── Maximize Conversions (volume)
│   ├── Have a target CPA? → Target CPA (tCPA)
│   └── No CPA target? → Maximize Conversions
│
├── Maximize Revenue (value)
│   ├── Have a target ROAS? → Target ROAS (tROAS)
│   └── No ROAS target? → Maximize Conversion Value
│
├── Traffic / Clicks
│   └── Maximize Clicks (set max CPC cap)
│
├── Awareness / Impressions
│   └── Target Impression Share
│
└── Full Control (low volume)
    └── Manual CPC (Enhanced optional)
```

### Bidding Strategy Selection Criteria

| Strategy | Min. Monthly Conversions | When to Use | Watch Out For |
|---|---|---|---|
| tCPA | 30+ | Stable CPA goal, lead gen | Set realistic targets (start at 2x actual) |
| tROAS | 50+ | E-commerce, variable values | Needs accurate conversion values |
| Max Conversions | 15+ | New campaigns, budget-constrained | Can overspend on low-quality conversions |
| Max Conv Value | 15+ | Revenue focus, no ROAS target | May chase high-value outliers |
| Manual CPC | Any | Low volume, testing | Labor-intensive, misses signals |

## Keyword Match Type Strategy

| Match Type | Syntax | Behavior (2024+) | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Broad | `keyword` | Widest reach; meaning + intent | Pair with smart bidding; primary driver |
| Phrase | `"keyword"` | Contains meaning in order | Mid-control; specific intent sequences |
| Exact | `[keyword]` | Closest meaning match | High-value, proven converters |

### Modern Keyword Strategy
1. **Start with broad match + tCPA/tROAS** — let smart bidding optimize
2. **Use exact match for top performers** — protect budget on proven terms
3. **Phrase match for specificity** — when broad pulls irrelevant traffic
4. **Search term analysis weekly** — mine for negatives and new keywords
5. **Avoid keyword overlap** — deduplicate across ad groups to prevent self-competition

## Quality Score Optimization

### Quality Score Components

| Component | Weight | How to Improve |
|---|---|---|
| Expected CTR | ~35% | Compelling ad copy, strong CTAs, ad extensions |
| Ad Relevance | ~25% | Match ad copy to keyword intent, use keyword in headlines |
| Landing Page Experience | ~40% | Page speed, mobile-friendly, relevant content, clear CTA |

### Quality Score Improvement Checklist
- [ ] Keyword appears in at least 2 of 15 RSA headlines
- [ ] Landing page headline matches search intent
- [ ] Page loads in under 3 seconds (mobile)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design verified
- [ ] Clear above-the-fold CTA
- [ ] Content directly addresses searcher's query
- [ ] Minimal pop-ups and interstitials

## RSA (Responsive Search Ad) Writing Strategy

### Headline Framework (15 Headlines)

| Slot | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| H1–H3 | Primary value prop (pin H1 to position 1) | "Award-Winning Project Management Software" |
| H4–H6 | Features / differentiators | "Real-Time Collaboration Tools" |
| H7–H9 | Social proof / trust signals | "Trusted by 10,000+ Teams Worldwide" |
| H10–H12 | CTAs and offers | "Start Your Free 14-Day Trial" |
| H13–H14 | Keyword insertion / location | "Best {KeyWord:PM Tool} for Teams" |
| H15 | Seasonal or test variant | "New 2025 Features Now Available" |

### Description Framework (4 Descriptions)
1. **Primary value prop + CTA** — comprehensive benefit statement with action
2. **Features and proof points** — specific capabilities, stats, awards
3. **Objection handling** — no credit card, free trial, money-back guarantee
4. **Urgency / offer** — limited time, seasonal hook, discount

### Pinning Strategy
- Pin your strongest brand headline to Position 1
- Pin your strongest CTA to Position 2 (optional)
- Never pin more than 2 headlines — let Google optimize
- Pin one description only if compliance requires specific language

## Performance Max Setup Checklist

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Conversion tracking verified (offline + online, with values if possible)
- [ ] Enhanced conversions enabled
- [ ] Google Merchant Center connected (e-commerce)
- [ ] Google Business Profile linked (local)
- [ ] YouTube channel linked
- [ ] Audience signals configured (custom segments, customer lists, website visitors)
- [ ] Brand exclusions applied (if available)

### Asset Group Configuration
- [ ] 20 text assets (5 headlines, 5 long headlines, 5 descriptions, 1 business name, 4 sitelinks minimum)
- [ ] 20 image assets (various aspect ratios: 1.91:1, 1:1, 4:5)
- [ ] 5 video assets (landscape, portrait, square — at least 10 seconds)
- [ ] Final URL expansion ON or OFF based on strategy
- [ ] URL exclusions set to prevent irrelevant landing pages

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Allow 2–4 weeks learning phase before major changes
- [ ] Review asset performance ratings weekly (replace "Low" assets)
- [ ] Check Insights tab for audience and search category data
- [ ] Monitor placement reports for brand safety
- [ ] Compare PMax performance against brand search (cannibalization check)

## Negative Keyword Management

### Negative Match Types

| Type | Syntax | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Broad Negative | `keyword` | Any query containing all negative terms (any order) |
| Phrase Negative | `"keyword"` | Queries containing the exact phrase in order |
| Exact Negative | `[keyword]` | Only the exact query |

### Negative Keyword Best Practices
- [ ] Create shared negative keyword lists at account level
- [ ] Review search terms report weekly (daily during launch)
- [ ] Maintain standard exclusion lists: jobs, free, DIY, reviews, competitors (if desired)
- [ ] Add negatives at campaign level for specificity, account level for universal
- [ ] Export and audit negative lists quarterly — over-negating kills volume
- [ ] Cross-reference negatives against active keywords to prevent conflicts

### Standard Negative Lists to Maintain
1. **Brand Protection**: competitor names (if not targeting)
2. **Intent Exclusion**: "free," "jobs," "salary," "how to," "DIY"
3. **Irrelevant Modifiers**: "cheap," "used," (industry-specific terms)
4. **Compliance**: restricted terms for your vertical

## Shopping Feed Optimization

### Required Feed Attributes (Optimize These)

| Attribute | Optimization Tip |
|---|---|
| `title` | Front-load with brand + product type + key attribute (color, size). Max 150 chars. |
| `description` | Include relevant keywords naturally. First 160 chars matter most. |
| `product_type` | Use full category path: Home > Furniture > Sofas > Sectional Sofas |
| `google_product_category` | Map to most specific Google taxonomy ID |
| `image_link` | White background, high resolution, no watermarks, no promotional overlays |
| `price` | Must match landing page exactly; use `sale_price` for promos |
| `availability` | Keep in sync — disapprovals for mismatches hurt account health |
| `gtin` / `mpn` | Always provide when available; enables richer placements |
| `custom_labels` | Tag by margin, best-seller, seasonal, clearance for bid segmentation |

### Feed Health Checklist
- [ ] Zero disapprovals (check Diagnostics daily)
- [ ] Supplemental feed for overrides without touching primary feed
- [ ] Feed refresh frequency: minimum daily, ideally every 6 hours
- [ ] All variants (size, color) listed as separate items
- [ ] Promotional feed connected for merchant promotions
- [ ] Feed rules configured for automated attribute fixes
- [ ] Competitive pricing data reviewed via Price Competitiveness report
