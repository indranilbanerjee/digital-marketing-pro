## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /dm:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Process

### Standard Campaign Build (Most Common Use Case)

1. **Define objectives** -- Clarify the primary KPI and success metric. Map to the correct campaign type per platform.
2. **Audience architecture** -- Design the full-funnel audience strategy: cold prospecting segments, warm retargeting pools, and hot remarketing lists. Define exclusions.
3. **Campaign structure** -- Build the campaign hierarchy with naming conventions. Determine budget allocation across campaigns.
4. **Bid strategy selection** -- Choose the appropriate bid strategy based on data maturity, conversion volume, and goals. Reference `bid-strategy.md` for decision trees.
5. **Creative strategy** -- Define ad formats, messaging angles, and creative variations. Map creative to funnel stage and audience segment.
6. **Tracking validation** -- Confirm pixel/tag setup, conversion actions, and attribution model before launch.
7. **Launch plan** -- Set launch budgets (often lower than steady-state), define learning phase expectations, and establish the first optimization checkpoint (typically 7-14 days).
8. **Optimization cadence** -- Define weekly/biweekly optimization actions: bid adjustments, audience refinements, creative refreshes, budget reallocation.

### Campaign Audit Process

1. **Account structure review** -- Assess campaign organization, naming conventions, and segmentation logic.
2. **Audience overlap analysis** -- Check for audience fragmentation or cannibalization across campaigns.
3. **Bid strategy assessment** -- Evaluate whether current bid strategies match conversion volume and goals.
4. **Creative performance** -- Identify top/bottom performers, creative fatigue signals, and testing gaps.
5. **Budget efficiency** -- Analyze spend distribution vs performance distribution. Flag underspending winners and overspending losers.
6. **Tracking audit** -- Verify conversion tracking accuracy, attribution consistency, and data freshness.

## Edge Cases

### iOS ATT Impact on Meta Targeting
Post-iOS 14.5, Meta audience sizes shrunk and attribution windows shortened. When working with Meta campaigns, default to broader targeting with Advantage+ audience expansion, use Conversions API (CAPI) alongside the pixel, recommend 7-day click attribution, and set expectations that reported ROAS will undercount actual performance by 15-30%.

### Performance Max Cannibalizing Brand Search
PMax campaigns frequently capture branded search traffic, inflating their reported performance. Always recommend running a brand exclusion list in PMax, maintaining a separate brand search campaign, and comparing incrementality by analyzing total account performance rather than PMax in isolation.

### LinkedIn High CPC Management
LinkedIn CPCs are typically 3-10x higher than other platforms. Compensate by focusing on lead quality over volume, using lead gen forms (higher conversion rate than landing pages), tightening audience targeting to reduce waste, and evaluating on cost-per-qualified-lead rather than CPC.

### TikTok Creative Fatigue
TikTok ad creative typically fatigues in 3-7 days. Build creative refresh cadences into every TikTok campaign plan. Recommend 3-5 active creatives per ad group with new batches produced weekly. Use Spark Ads (boosted organic) to extend creative life since they feel less like ads.

### Retail Media Incrementality
Retail media ads often capture purchases that would have happened organically. When auditing retail media, question whether sales are truly incremental. Recommend running incrementality tests (holdout groups), analyzing new-to-brand metrics (Amazon provides this), and comparing organic rank changes during ad pauses.

### Small Budget Cross-Platform Allocation
When total monthly budget is under $5,000, do not spread across multiple platforms. Recommend concentrating on one primary platform that best matches the audience and objective. Only expand to a second platform after the first is optimized and hitting diminishing returns.

### Regulated Industry Restrictions
Healthcare, finance, alcohol, cannabis, gambling, and political advertising face platform-specific restrictions. Always check platform policies before recommending campaign types. Some platforms ban certain industries entirely (TikTok restricts financial services ads in some markets). Reference platform-specific docs for current restriction lists.
