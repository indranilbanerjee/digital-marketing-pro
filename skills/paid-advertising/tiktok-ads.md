### Campaign Structure
```
Campaign (Objective + Budget)
├── Ad Group 1 (Targeting + Placement + Schedule + Bid)
│   ├── Ad 1 (Creative + CTA)
│   ├── Ad 2
│   └── Ad 3
├── Ad Group 2
│   ├── Ad 1
│   └── Ad 2
└── Ad Group 3
    └── ...
```

### Structure Best Practices
- [ ] 3–5 ad groups per campaign to allow testing
- [ ] 3–6 creatives per ad group — TikTok burns through creative fast
- [ ] Minimum daily budget: $20/ad group for conversion campaigns
- [ ] Avoid audience overlap between ad groups (use exclusions)
- [ ] Consolidate when possible — give the algorithm enough data per ad group

## TikTok-Native Creative Best Practices

### The 3-Second Rule
TikTok's average attention span demands an instant hook. If you don't capture attention in the first frame, you lose the viewer.

### Creative Framework: Hook → Body → CTA

| Phase | Timing | Purpose | Techniques |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hook** | 0–3 seconds | Stop the scroll | Bold text overlay, surprising visual, direct question, controversy, "Wait for it" |
| **Body** | 3–15 seconds | Deliver value or story | Demo, transformation, problem/solution, testimonial, tutorial |
| **CTA** | Last 2–5 seconds | Drive action | Text overlay + verbal CTA, urgency, promo code, "Link in bio" |

### Creative Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Shoot vertical (9:16) natively on phone | Repurpose horizontal TV/YouTube spots |
| Use trending sounds and music | Use copyrighted music without licensing |
| Feature real people and authentic voices | Use overly polished, corporate production |
| Add text overlays for silent viewing | Rely solely on audio to convey message |
| Match organic TikTok aesthetic | Use static images or stock footage |
| Test new hooks every 3–5 days | Run same creative longer than 7–14 days |
| Show the product in use within first 3 seconds | Bury the product reveal at the end |
| Use native transitions (jump cuts, zooms) | Use heavy graphic transitions |

### Top-Performing Creative Formats

| Format | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| UGC Testimonial | Real person talking to camera about experience | D2C, app promotion |

| Day-in-the-Life | Lifestyle integration of product | Apparel, food, wellness |
| Trending Sound Remix | Brand message overlaid on trending audio | Awareness, engagement |

| Stitch/Duet Style | React to or build on existing content | Community, engagement |

## Spark Ads Setup

## Measurement & Attribution

### Key Metrics by Objective

| Objective | Primary KPI | Secondary KPIs |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | CPM, Reach, Frequency | Video view rate (2s, 6s), brand lift |
| Consideration | CPC, CTR, Video completion | Engagement rate, profile visits |
| Conversion | CPA, ROAS, Conv Rate | Add-to-cart rate, checkout rate |
| Commerce (Shop) | ROAS, GMV, Units Sold | Order volume, AOV, return rate |

### Attribution Considerations
- Default attribution window: 7-day click, 1-day view
- TikTok tends to overcount view-through conversions — cross-reference with GA4
- Use UTM parameters on all destination URLs for platform-independent measurement
- Consider incrementality testing (holdout studies) for true impact measurement
- TikTok Attribution Analytics provides cross-channel assisted conversion data

### Benchmarks (Cross-Industry Averages)

| Metric | In-Feed Ads | Spark Ads | TopView |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTR | 0.8–1.5% | 1.5–3.0% | 12–16% |
| CPC | $0.50–$2.00 | $0.30–$1.50 | N/A (CPM buy) |
| CPM | $6–$15 | $5–$12 | $50–$80 |
| Video View Rate (6s) | 15–25% | 20–35% | 40–60% |
| Conv Rate (landing page) | 1–3% | 1.5–4% | 2–5% |

> **Note:** TikTok performance is heavily creative-dependent. Top-performing creative can outperform averages by 3–5x. Refresh creative every 7–14 days to maintain performance and combat fatigue.
