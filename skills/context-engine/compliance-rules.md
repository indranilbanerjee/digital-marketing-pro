## Section 1: Geographic Privacy Laws

### 1.1 EU/EEA — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | European Union / European Economic Area (27 EU member states + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) |
| **Law** | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2016 (enforced May 25, 2018) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Explicit, informed, freely given, specific, and unambiguous consent required before processing personal data. Consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give. Legitimate interest may apply in narrow B2B contexts but requires a documented balancing test. |
| **Email Rules** | Prior opt-in required for all marketing emails. Soft opt-in exception: existing customers may be emailed about similar products/services if given an easy opt-out at collection and in every message. Every email must include sender identity, physical address, and a functional unsubscribe mechanism honored within 30 days. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Prior consent required for all non-essential cookies and trackers (ePrivacy Directive). Cookie banners must allow granular choice (accept/reject by category). Pre-ticked boxes are invalid. Analytics cookies require consent unless strictly necessary. Server-side tracking of personal data still requires a lawful basis. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to EUR 20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. Supervisory authorities may also issue warnings, bans on processing, and orders to erase data. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Double opt-in is industry standard. All lead forms need clear consent checkboxes (not bundled). Data Processing Agreements required with every martech vendor. Privacy policy must disclose all data recipients. Cross-border data transfers require adequacy decisions, SCCs, or BCRs. Right to erasure means suppression lists must be maintained. Profiling for ad targeting requires explicit consent or legitimate interest with opt-out. |

### 1.2 United States Federal — CAN-SPAM Act

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United States (federal) |
| **Law** | Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2003 (effective January 1, 2004; amended 2008) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-out. No prior consent required to send commercial email. Recipients must be given a clear way to opt out, and opt-out requests must be honored within 10 business days. |
| **Email Rules** | No deceptive subject lines. "From" and "Reply-To" must accurately identify the sender. Every commercial email must include: a clear identification as an advertisement (if applicable), the sender's valid physical postal address, and a conspicuous opt-out mechanism. Purchased lists are legal but opt-out obligations still apply. Transactional emails are exempt if their primary purpose is transactional. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | No federal cookie consent law. Tracking pixels in email are legal. The FTC enforces against deceptive tracking practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to $51,744 per violation (per email). ISPs and state attorneys general may also bring actions. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Lower bar than GDPR but strict on opt-out honoring. Affiliate and partner emails count — the brand whose product is promoted is liable. "Sender" definition includes the entity whose product is advertised. Suppression list management is critical. Header manipulation is a criminal offense. |

### 1.3 California — CCPA / CPRA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | California, United States |
| **Law** | California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA, 2018) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA, 2020; fully operative January 1, 2023) |
| **Year Enacted** | CCPA: 2018. CPRA amendment: 2020 (enforced 2023). |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-out for sale/sharing of personal information. Opt-in required for consumers under 16 (under 13 requires parental consent). "Sharing" includes cross-context behavioral advertising. |
| **Email Rules** | CAN-SPAM governs email. CCPA/CPRA layer on top: consumers can opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of personal information used for email targeting and personalization. Honoring Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals is required. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Third-party cookies and ad pixels that share data with ad platforms constitute "sharing" under CPRA. A "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link must be on the website. GPC browser signals must be honored as a valid opt-out. |
| **Penalty Range** | $2,500 per unintentional violation; $7,500 per intentional violation. Private right of action for data breaches ($100–$750 per consumer per incident). Enforced by the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Retargeting audiences using third-party data requires opt-out mechanism. Service provider agreements needed with all martech vendors. 12-month lookback on data collection disclosures. "Sensitive personal information" (e.g., geolocation, race, health) triggers additional restrictions — limit use to what is necessary. |

### 1.4 US State Privacy Laws (Multi-State Summary)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United States — 20+ states with enacted comprehensive privacy laws |
| **Laws** | Virginia (VCDPA, 2023), Colorado (CPA, 2023), Connecticut (CTDPA, 2023), Utah (UCPA, 2023), Iowa (ICDPA, 2025), Indiana (ICDPA, 2026), Tennessee (TIPA, 2025), Montana (MCDPA, 2024), Texas (TDPSA, 2024), Oregon (OCPA, 2024), Delaware (DPDPA, 2025), New Hampshire (SB 255, 2025), New Jersey (SB 332, 2025), Nebraska (NDPA, 2025), Maryland (MODPA, 2025), Minnesota (MCDPA, 2025), Rhode Island (RIDPA, 2026), Kentucky (KCDPA, 2026), Vermont (VDPA, 2025), and others pending. |
| **Year Enacted** | Rolling: 2021–2026. Most operative between 2023–2026. |
| **Consent Model** | Generally opt-out for sale of data and targeted advertising. Opt-in for sensitive data processing. Most follow the VCDPA template. Maryland and Minnesota are more restrictive (closer to GDPR's data minimization standard). |
| **Email Rules** | Defer to CAN-SPAM federally. State laws add data rights (access, deletion, correction, portability) that affect CRM and email list management. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Most require opt-out rights for targeted advertising (which implicates ad cookies and pixels). Universal opt-out mechanisms (like GPC) are mandated in Colorado, Connecticut, Texas, Montana, Oregon, Delaware, and others. |
| **Penalty Range** | Typically $7,500–$10,000 per violation. Most enforced by the state Attorney General. Few have private rights of action. Cure periods (30–60 days) are common in early-enacted laws but are being removed in newer laws. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Treat the US as a patchwork. The safest approach is to build to the most restrictive standard (currently Maryland or CPRA) and apply nationally. Universal opt-out signal support is becoming table stakes. Data mapping is essential to know which state laws apply to which consumers. |

### 1.5 Canada — CASL

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Canada |
| **Law** | Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2014 |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Express consent required for commercial electronic messages (CEMs). Implied consent exists in limited cases: existing business relationship (within 2 years of purchase, 6 months of inquiry), conspicuous publication of address (if relevant to role), or disclosure via referral. |
| **Email Rules** | Every CEM must include: sender identification, contact information (physical and digital), and a functional unsubscribe mechanism processed within 10 business days. Consent records must be retained with proof of how and when consent was obtained. Consent requests themselves cannot contain marketing. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | CASL requires consent for installation of programs on devices. Cookie consent is governed by PIPEDA (federal privacy law) — implied consent may suffice for functional/analytics cookies, but tracking for ad targeting should use express consent. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to CAD $10 million per violation (individuals: $1 million). CRTC enforces. Private right of action was enacted but enforcement is through administrative monetary penalties. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | One of the strictest email laws globally. Implied consent windows are short — CRM must track consent expiry. "Conspicuous publication" is narrow and does not cover scraping. B2B cold outreach is heavily restricted. Referral/tell-a-friend programs require careful structuring. |

### 1.6 Brazil — LGPD

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Brazil |
| **Law** | Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados (LGPD) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2018 (enforced September 2020; penalties from August 2021) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be free, informed, and unambiguous for a specific purpose. Legitimate interest is available as an alternative basis but requires a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA). |
| **Email Rules** | Consent or legitimate interest required. Unsubscribe must be easy and immediate. Data subjects have rights to access, correction, deletion, and portability. Marketing communications must identify the sender and purpose. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | ANPD (National Data Protection Authority) guidance requires consent for non-essential cookies. Cookie banners with accept/reject options are standard practice. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to 2% of revenue in Brazil, capped at BRL 50 million (~USD 10 million) per violation. ANPD may also issue warnings, publicize violations, and block or delete data. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Similar structure to GDPR but with a revenue cap specific to Brazilian operations. Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointment is mandatory. Cross-border transfers require adequacy, contractual safeguards, or consent. Portuguese-language privacy notices required. |

### 1.7 United Kingdom — UK GDPR + PECR

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United Kingdom |
| **Law** | UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) + Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) |
| **Year Enacted** | UK GDPR: 2018 (retained post-Brexit, 2021). PECR: 2003. |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in for marketing. PECR requires prior consent for unsolicited marketing emails to individuals. Soft opt-in exception (similar to EU): existing customers can be emailed about similar products if opt-out was offered at collection and in each message. B2B exception: corporate email addresses (e.g., info@company.com) may be contacted without prior consent under PECR, but UK GDPR still requires a lawful basis. |
| **Email Rules** | Same structural requirements as GDPR: sender identity, physical address, unsubscribe. ICO enforces. Unsolicited B2C email without consent is a PECR violation. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | PECR requires prior consent for non-essential cookies. ICO has signaled stricter enforcement. Legitimate interest is not a valid basis for ad cookies under PECR. |
| **Penalty Range** | UK GDPR: up to GBP 17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. PECR: up to GBP 500,000. ICO enforcement. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Post-Brexit, UK adequacy decision from the EU allows data flows, but this is subject to review. Data Protection Impact Assessments required for high-risk processing (profiling, large-scale marketing). ICO publishes direct marketing guidance — treat as binding. International transfers require UK-specific transfer mechanisms (UK SCCs, IDTA). |

### 1.8 Australia — Privacy Act + Spam Act

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Australia |
| **Law** | Privacy Act 1988 (Australian Privacy Principles) + Spam Act 2003 |
| **Year Enacted** | Privacy Act: 1988 (APPs added 2014). Spam Act: 2003. |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in under the Spam Act for commercial electronic messages. Consent can be express or inferred (from an existing business relationship or conspicuous publication). The Privacy Act uses a "reasonable expectation" standard for use of personal information. |
| **Email Rules** | Spam Act requires: consent (express or inferred), accurate sender identification, functional unsubscribe honored within 5 business days. Address harvesting and list selling are prohibited. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | No specific cookie consent law currently. The Privacy Act requires transparency about data collection. The government's Privacy Act Review (2023–2025) is expected to introduce stronger consent requirements for tracking — monitor for changes. |
| **Penalty Range** | Spam Act: up to AUD 2.22 million per day for body corporates. Privacy Act: up to AUD 50 million, 3x the benefit obtained, or 30% of adjusted turnover (whichever is greater) following 2022 amendments. ACMA and OAIC enforce. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Spam Act prohibits address harvesting software and purchased scraped lists. Inferred consent from business relationships is relatively broad but must be documented. The Privacy Act's 2022 penalty increase makes Australia a high-consequence jurisdiction. Cross-border disclosure to overseas recipients requires reasonable steps to ensure compliance. |

### 1.9 Singapore — PDPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Singapore |
| **Law** | Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2012 (significant amendments 2021) |

| **Email Rules** | Do Not Call (DNC) Registry: mandatory to check before sending marketing messages to Singapore numbers/addresses. Opt-out must be free and processed within 10 business days. Sender must be identified. |

| **Penalty Range** | Up to SGD 1 million or 10% of annual turnover in Singapore (whichever is higher, following 2021 amendments). PDPC enforces. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | DNC Registry check is mandatory and unique to Singapore — scrub all contact lists. Data breach notification mandatory within 3 days. Data Protection Officers must be appointed. Consent withdrawal must be easy. Cross-border transfers require comparable protection. |

### 1.10 China — PIPL

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | People's Republic of China |
| **Law** | Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2021 (effective November 1, 2021) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Separate consent required for: sensitive personal information, cross-border transfers, public disclosure, and processing by third parties. Consent must be informed, voluntary, and explicit. |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires consent. Individuals have the right to refuse and withdraw. All processing purposes must be disclosed. No specific email-format statute like CAN-SPAM, but general consent and transparency obligations apply. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Consent required for collection of personal information via cookies and trackers. Automated decision-making (algorithmic recommendations, targeted ads) must offer an opt-out and a non-personalized alternative. |

Separate consent for each purpose. Personal Information Protection Impact Assessments required for sensitive data, automated decision-making, and cross-border transfers. Local DPO or representative required if processing from outside China. |

### 1.11 India — DPDPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | India |
| **Law** | Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2023 (rules pending finalization as of early 2025) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous. Deemed consent applies for "legitimate uses" (e.g., voluntary data provision for a stated purpose, employment, medical emergencies). |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires consent. Must provide easy opt-out. The Consent Manager framework (government-registered entities managing consent) may apply once rules are finalized. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Not specifically addressed yet. General consent obligation for processing personal data likely extends to cookie-based tracking. Await implementing rules for specifics. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to INR 250 crore (~USD 30 million) per violation. No percentage-of-revenue calculation. Data Protection Board of India enforces. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Rules are still being finalized — build for the strictest interpretation. Children's data (under 18) requires verifiable parental consent and prohibits targeted advertising and tracking. Cross-border transfers allowed except to government-restricted countries. Consent withdrawal must be as easy as giving consent. Significant Data Fiduciaries (large-scale processors) face additional obligations including DPO appointment, audits, and impact assessments. |

### 1.12 Japan — APPI

| **Penalty Range** | Criminal penalties for certain violations (up to JPY 100 million for corporations). PPC can issue orders and recommendations. Reputational enforcement is significant in Japan. 2022 amendments increased penalties. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Japan has an EU adequacy decision (mutual), facilitating EU-Japan data flows. Pseudonymized data has a specific legal regime — can be used for internal analytics without consent but cannot be provided to third parties. Breach notification to PPC and affected individuals is mandatory. "Individually referable information" concept means cookie syncing and DMP practices need consent. |

### 1.13 South Korea — PIPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | South Korea |
| **Law** | Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2011 (major amendments 2023, effective 2024) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Among the strictest globally. Consent must be separate from other terms, clearly distinguishable, and specific. Separate consent required for: collection, use, third-party provision, and cross-border transfer. |

| **Penalty Range** | Up to AED 20 million (~USD 5.4 million). UAE Data Office enforces. DIFC Commissioner and ADGM have separate penalty regimes for free zone entities. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Three overlapping regimes: federal law, DIFC (own law modeled on GDPR), and ADGM (own regulations). Determine which applies based on entity registration and data subject location. Cross-border transfer requires adequacy, contractual safeguards, or consent. Arabic-language notices advisable. Free zone entities should follow zone-specific rules which may be stricter. |

## Section 3: FTC Advertising Rules

### 3.1 FTC Endorsement Guides (Revised 2023)

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Material Connection Disclosure** | Any material connection between an endorser and the brand must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. Material connections include: payment, free products, employment, family relationships, business partnerships, equity stakes, and affiliate commissions. |
| **Placement** | Disclosures must be in the same medium as the endorsement, unavoidable by the audience, and in clear language. For social media: within the post text (not hidden in hashtag strings), visible without clicking "more," and in the first lines of a caption. For video: spoken and in text overlay, not just in the description. |
| **Required Language** | Use clear terms: "#ad," "#sponsored," "Paid partnership with [Brand]." Ambiguous terms are insufficient: "#ambassador," "#collab," "#partner" alone do not meet FTC standards. Platform-specific disclosure tools (e.g., "Paid Partnership" tags) are helpful but may not be sufficient alone — a text disclosure is still recommended. |
| **Endorser Liability** | Both the brand AND the endorser can be held liable for non-disclosure. Brands must have reasonable monitoring programs for endorser compliance. Written agreements should include disclosure requirements. |
| **Honest Opinion** | Endorsements must reflect the honest opinion or experience of the endorser. Endorsers must have actually used the product/service. Scripts that misrepresent the endorser's experience violate FTC rules. |
| **Celebrity/Expert Endorsements** | Expert endorsers must have genuine expertise in the field. Celebrity endorsers must actually use the product. Expertise claims must be truthful. AI-generated or deepfake "endorsements" of real people without consent are deceptive. |

### 3.2 FTC Consumer Review Fairness and Rule on Fake Reviews (2024)

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Fake Reviews Ban** | Businesses may not create, buy, sell, or disseminate fake consumer reviews, testimonials, or celebrity endorsements. This includes reviews by employees or insiders not disclosing their connection. |
| **AI-Generated Reviews** | AI-generated reviews presented as human experiences are prohibited. AI-assisted review solicitation is permitted if the review reflects the genuine customer's experience. |
| **Review Suppression** | Businesses may not use unfounded legal threats, contract terms, or other means to suppress negative reviews. Filtering out only negative reviews while publishing positive ones is deceptive. |
| **Review Manipulation** | Buying positive reviews, incentivizing only positive reviews, or manipulating review platforms to boost ratings is prohibited. Soliciting reviews generally is permitted as long as the solicitation is not conditional on a positive review. |
| **Penalty** | Civil penalties up to $51,744 per violation. Applies to businesses, review brokers, and platforms that knowingly facilitate fake reviews. |

### 3.3 Influencer Disclosure Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **When to Disclose** | Any time there is a material connection between the influencer and the brand — even for gifted products, affiliate links, or business relationships. |
| **How to Disclose** | Clear, unambiguous language at the beginning of the content. "#ad" at the start of social posts, spoken disclosure at the beginning of videos, and visible text in image posts. Must be understandable in the language of the audience. |
| **Platform-Specific** | Instagram/TikTok: "#ad" in first line + platform partnership label. YouTube: spoken + text in video + description box. Podcasts: spoken disclosure in the episode (not just show notes). Blog/newsletter: clear disclosure at the top of the post. |
| **Brand Responsibility** | Brands must: (1) clearly inform influencers of disclosure requirements in contracts, (2) monitor compliance, (3) take action when violations are found. A contractual clause alone is insufficient — active monitoring is required. |

### 3.4 AI-Generated Content Disclosure

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **FTC Position** | AI-generated content that could be mistaken for human-created content must be disclosed. This includes AI-generated images, text, voices, and video used in marketing. |
| **Deepfakes** | Using AI to create realistic depictions of real people without their consent is deceptive. AI-generated endorsements by fabricated "people" must be disclosed as AI-generated. |
| **AI in Reviews** | AI-generated reviews are fake reviews under FTC rules. AI tools may assist humans in writing reviews, but the review must reflect genuine experience. |
| **Best Practice** | Disclose AI involvement in content creation when a reasonable consumer would consider it material. Label AI-generated imagery clearly. Do not use AI voices mimicking real individuals without consent and disclosure. |

### 3.5 Testimonial Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Typicality** | If a testimonial describes results that are not typical, the ad must clearly disclose what results consumers can generally expect. "Results not typical" alone is insufficient — must state typical results. |
| **Truthfulness** | Testimonials must reflect honest, genuine experiences. Cannot be fabricated, materially altered, or taken out of context. |
| **Substantiation** | Claims made through testimonials are treated as claims by the advertiser and must be substantiated. |
| **Expert Endorsements** | Must be supported by an actual examination, testing, or evaluation by the expert. The expert must have qualifications in the relevant field. |

### 3.6 FTC Penalty Structure

| Violation Type | Penalty Range |
|---|---|
| **Section 5 (Unfair or Deceptive Acts)** | Consent orders, cease and desist, corrective advertising. No direct fines for first-time Section 5 violations, but violation of a consent order: up to $51,744 per violation. |
| **Penalty Offense Authority** | FTC can seek civil penalties from companies that had prior notice that conduct is unlawful (via prior FTC cases). Up to $51,744 per violation. |
| **Fake Reviews Rule (2024)** | Civil penalties up to $51,744 per violation. |
| **COPPA Violations** | Up to $51,744 per violation. |
| **Restitution/Disgorgement** | FTC can seek consumer redress through federal courts. AMG Capital Management v. FTC (2021) limited FTC's Section 13(b) authority, but Congress is working to restore it. |

## Section 5: Accessibility Requirements

### 5.1 WCAG 2.1 AA — Marketing Content Requirements

| Criterion | Requirement | Marketing Application |
|---|---|---|
| **1.1.1 Non-text Content** | All non-text content has a text alternative serving the equivalent purpose. | All marketing images, infographics, charts, and icons require meaningful alt text. Decorative images use empty alt (`alt=""`). CTA buttons in images must have alt text describing the action. |
| **1.2.1 Audio/Video (Prerecorded)** | Provide alternatives for time-based media. | Marketing videos require captions. Podcasts require transcripts. Webinar recordings need both captions and descriptive audio where visual-only info is presented. |
| **1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)** | Captions for all prerecorded audio in synchronized media. | All video ads, social media videos, and embedded video content must have accurate captions — not auto-generated without review. |
| **1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)** | Audio description for prerecorded video content (AA). | Marketing videos where visual-only content conveys key information need audio description tracks (e.g., product demos, tutorials). |
| **1.3.1 Info and Relationships** | Structure and relationships conveyed through presentation are programmatically determinable. | Email templates must use semantic HTML (headings, lists, tables with headers). Landing pages must use proper heading hierarchy. Forms must have associated labels. |
| **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence** | Content reading order is correct when linearized. | Email layouts must make sense when CSS is disabled or images don't load. Single-column fallback for responsive emails. |
| **1.4.1 Use of Color** | Color is not the only visual means of conveying information. | CTA buttons must not rely solely on color to indicate interactivity. Error states in forms need text labels, not just red highlighting. Charts need patterns or labels in addition to color coding. |
| **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** | Text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): 3:1. | All marketing copy, CTAs, and navigation text must meet contrast minimums. Brand colors must be tested. White text on light backgrounds and light gray text are common failures. |
| **1.4.4 Resize Text** | Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality. | Landing pages and web content must remain functional at 200% zoom. No fixed-width containers that cause horizontal scrolling. |
| **1.4.5 Images of Text** | Use actual text rather than images of text (with exceptions for logos). | Avoid embedding key marketing copy in images. Headline text in banner ads should be HTML where possible. Social images with text should have alt text containing the text. |
| **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** | UI components and graphical objects: 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors. | Form field borders, CTA button borders, icons, and chart elements must meet 3:1 contrast. Focus indicators must be visible. |

| **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)** | Purpose of each link can be determined from link text or context. | Avoid "Click here" and "Read more" as standalone link text. Use descriptive text: "Download the 2025 Marketing Report" instead of "Download." |
| **2.4.6 Headings and Labels** | Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. | Landing page sections need descriptive headings. Form labels must clearly describe the expected input. |
| **2.4.7 Focus Visible** | Keyboard focus indicator is visible. | Do not remove outline styles from interactive elements on landing pages. Custom focus indicators must meet 3:1 contrast. |
| **3.1.1 Language of Page** | Default human language of each page is programmatically determinable. | Set `lang` attribute on HTML element. Multilingual marketing pages need `lang` attributes on sections in different languages. |
| **3.2.1 On Focus** | No context change on focus. | No auto-redirect, modal popup, or form submission triggered solely by focusing an element. |
| **3.2.2 On Input** | No context change on input unless user is informed beforehand. | Form field changes should not trigger page navigation. Auto-submit on dropdown selection is non-compliant without warning. |
| **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** | All UI components have accessible name, role, and state information. | Custom components (dropdowns, toggles, tabs, sliders) on landing pages must use ARIA roles, states, and properties correctly. |

### 5.2 ADA Website Compliance

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Legal Basis** | Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. DOJ has confirmed that websites of public accommodations must be accessible. No specific technical standard is codified, but courts consistently reference WCAG 2.1 AA as the benchmark. |
| **Who Is Covered** | Any business that is a "place of public accommodation" (virtually all commercial websites, including e-commerce, SaaS, services, media). |
| **Enforcement** | Private lawsuits (ADA Title III does not provide damages in federal court but does in some states, notably California's Unruh Act: $4,000 minimum per violation per visit). DOJ enforcement actions. Demand letters are common. |
| **Marketing Implications** | All landing pages, microsites, campaign pages, and promotional web content must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. Pop-ups and modals must be keyboard-accessible and screen-reader-compatible. Video content needs captions. PDFs (whitepapers, ebooks) must be tagged for accessibility. Forms must have labels, error handling, and keyboard access. |
| **Auto-Applied Rules** | Flag landing pages without accessibility review. Require alt text on all images. Require caption files for video content. Flag color contrast issues in design assets. Require keyboard-accessible interactive elements. Flag PDF deliverables without accessibility tagging. |

### 5.3 Email Accessibility Standards

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Semantic HTML** | Use proper HTML elements: `<h1>`–`<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<table>` with `role="presentation"` for layout tables, `<th>` for data table headers. |
| **Alt Text** | Every `<img>` must have an `alt` attribute. Meaningful images get descriptive alt text. Decorative images use `alt=""`. CTA images (buttons, banners) get action-oriented alt text. |
| **Color Contrast** | Body text: 4.5:1 minimum. Large text: 3:1 minimum. CTA buttons: text must contrast with button background AND button must contrast with email background. |
| **Font Size** | Minimum 14px for body text, 22px+ for headings. Avoid font sizes below 12px for any content. Use relative units where supported. |
| **Link Styling** | Links must be distinguishable from surrounding text by more than just color (underline is standard). Link text must be descriptive. Avoid multiple links with identical text pointing to different URLs. |
| **Structure** | Single-column layouts are most accessible. If multi-column, ensure proper reading order in code. Use `dir` and `lang` attributes. Avoid relying on CSS-only layout that breaks in stripped-down email clients. |
| **Dark Mode** | Test in dark mode. Use transparent PNGs or match background colors. Ensure text remains readable when background colors are overridden. Provide both light and dark mode color declarations where supported. |
| **Screen Reader** | Include a `role="article"` on the main content wrapper. Use `aria-label` for navigation links if applicable. Avoid "View in browser" as the only way to access content. Preheader text should be meaningful (it's read aloud by screen readers). |
| **Auto-Applied Rules** | Flag images without alt text. Flag text below 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Flag body text below 14px. Flag link text that says "Click here" or "Read more." Flag layout tables without `role="presentation"`. Require single-column fallback for mobile/accessibility. |

---

## Rule Application Reference

When the context engine evaluates marketing content, apply rules in this priority order:

1. **Geographic law** — Identify target audience jurisdiction(s) and apply ALL applicable privacy/consent rules
2. **Industry regulation** — Identify the advertiser's industry and apply sector-specific restrictions
3. **FTC advertising rules** — Apply to all US-targeted content regardless of industry
4. **Platform policies** — Apply the specific platform's rules for the distribution channel
5. **Accessibility** — Apply WCAG 2.1 AA and email accessibility standards to all outputs

When rules conflict, apply the **most restrictive** standard. When jurisdiction is unknown, default to **GDPR + CPRA + FTC** as the baseline.

### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCK** | Violation would be illegal or result in platform ban (false health claims, missing disclosures on regulated products, COPPA violations, discriminatory targeting). | Do not output. Flag to user with specific rule citation. |
| **WARN** | Likely violation requiring human review (ambiguous claims, missing disclaimers, potential trademark issues, accessibility gaps). | Output with prominent warning and recommended fix. |
| **SUGGEST** | Best practice not strictly required by law but reduces risk (double opt-in where only opt-out required, adding disclaimers proactively, exceeding minimum contrast ratios). | Output with suggestion as a footnote. |
