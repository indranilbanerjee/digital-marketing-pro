## How to Apply Scoring

1. **Before creating content**: Reference the relevant rubric to guide creation
2. **After creating content**: Score the output against each dimension
3. **Report scores**: Include the total score and per-dimension breakdown
4. **Flag low dimensions**: Any dimension scoring below 50% of its max should be flagged for revision
5. **Track over time**: Scores saved to brand memory show content quality trends
