# /dm:funnel-audit

## Purpose

Analyze the complete customer acquisition and conversion funnel to identify where prospects drop off, why they disengage, and what changes will have the highest impact on overall conversion rate.

## Input Required

The user must provide (or will be prompted for):

- **Funnel stages**: The stages to analyze (or use standard: Awareness > Interest > Consideration > Intent > Purchase > Retention)
- **Funnel data**: Metrics per stage (traffic, leads, MQLs, SQLs, opportunities, customers) or qualitative description
- **Traffic sources**: Where visitors/leads originate
- **Conversion points**: Key actions at each stage (form fill, demo request, trial start, purchase)
- **Known pain points**: Any stages the user already suspects are underperforming
- **Tech stack**: CRM, analytics, and marketing automation tools in use

## Process

1. **Load brand context**: Read `~/.claude-marketing/brands/_active-brand.json` for the active slug, then load `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`. Apply brand voice, compliance rules for target markets (`skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`), and industry context. If no brand exists, ask: "Set up a brand first (/dm:brand-setup)?" — or proceed with defaults.
2. Map the current funnel with conversion rates between each stage
3. Benchmark stage-to-stage conversion rates against industry averages
4. Identify the biggest drop-off points and calculate revenue impact of each gap
5. Analyze potential causes per bottleneck: messaging, targeting, UX, timing, offer, follow-up
6. Evaluate lead quality signals — are the right people entering the funnel?
7. Assess nurture effectiveness at each stage
8. Model improvement scenarios: "If stage X improves by Y%, overall revenue increases by Z%"
9. Prioritize recommendations by revenue impact and implementation effort

## Output

A structured funnel audit containing:

- Funnel visualization with conversion rates per stage
- Industry benchmark comparison per stage
- Top 3 bottlenecks ranked by revenue impact
- Root cause analysis per bottleneck with supporting evidence
- Improvement scenarios with projected revenue impact
- Prioritized action plan with quick wins and strategic projects
- Measurement framework to track improvements
