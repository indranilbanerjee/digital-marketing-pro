# Switch Brand

## When to Use
- User says "switch to [brand name]" or "change brand to..."
- User wants to work on a different client/brand
- User asks to list available brands

## Process

### 1. List Available Brands
Run the setup script to show all configured brands:
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.py" --list-brands
```

The currently active brand is marked with `*`.

### 2. Switch Active Brand
When the user selects a brand, run:
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.py" --switch-brand BRAND_SLUG
```

### 3. Confirm Switch
After switching, confirm:
- Brand name and slug
- Key profile details (industry, business model, primary channel)
- Remind: "All marketing outputs will now use [brand_name]'s voice, compliance rules, and context."

## If Brand Not Found
- Show the list of available brands
- Offer to create a new brand: "Brand not found. Would you like to create a new profile? Use /dm:brand-setup"

## Multi-Brand Comparison
If the user asks to compare brands, load both profiles and present a side-by-side comparison of key attributes (voice settings, channels, goals).
