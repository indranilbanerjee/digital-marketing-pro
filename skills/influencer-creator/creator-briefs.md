## Creative Freedom Guidelines

### Three Tiers of Creative Direction

| Tier | Description | When to Use | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Prescribed** | Brand provides exact script, shot list, captions, and hashtags | Product launches, regulated industries, legal-sensitive messaging | Low creative risk, higher inauthenticity risk |
| **Collaborative** | Brand provides key messages and guidelines; creator proposes concept | Ongoing partnerships, brand awareness campaigns | Balanced — best for most campaigns |
| **Open** | Brand provides product and 2–3 key points; creator has full creative control | Nano/micro campaigns, UGC, authenticity-driven campaigns | Higher creative risk, highest authenticity |

### Creative Freedom Spectrum Decision Tree
1. Is this a regulated industry (pharma, finance, alcohol)? → **Prescribed**
2. Is this a product launch with exact messaging requirements? → **Prescribed**
3. Is this a mid-tier or macro creator with proven brand content? → **Collaborative**
4. Is this a nano/micro creator or UGC play? → **Open**
5. Is the primary KPI brand awareness / authenticity? → **Open**
6. Is the primary KPI conversions with specific offers? → **Collaborative** or **Prescribed**
