## Psychographic Data Collection Methods

### 1. Behavioral Inference
- Content consumed (topics, depth, format) → interests and knowledge level
- Products browsed/purchased → lifestyle and values
- Channel preference → communication style
- Time of engagement → lifestyle patterns

### 2. Survey Questions
- "What's most important when choosing [category]?" (forced rank: price, quality, speed, support, brand)
- "How would you describe your approach to new technology?" (early adopter → late majority)
- "What's your biggest professional challenge right now?" (open-ended)
- "Which of these statements best describes you?" (psychographic clustering)

### 3. Social Listening
- Topics they discuss and share → interests
- Tone and language used → communication style
- Influencers they follow → aspirations
- Hashtags and communities → identity and belonging

## Cultural Considerations

When profiling across cultures:

- **Individualism vs Collectivism**: Western markets (US, UK, AU) respond to personal achievement. Asian and Latin American markets respond to group benefit and harmony
- **Uncertainty Avoidance**: High UA cultures (Japan, Germany) need more proof and guarantees. Low UA cultures (US, UK) are more willing to take risks
- **Power Distance**: High PD cultures value authority and hierarchy in messaging. Low PD cultures prefer egalitarian, peer-level communication
- **Communication Style**: Direct cultures (US, Germany, Netherlands) prefer clear, explicit messaging. Indirect cultures (Japan, Korea) prefer subtle, contextual messaging

Always adapt psychographic profiling to the cultural context of the target market.
