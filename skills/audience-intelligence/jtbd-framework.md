# Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

## Overview

JTBD focuses on what customers are trying to accomplish (the "job") rather than who they are (demographics). People don't buy products — they hire them to make progress in their lives.

## Job Statement Format

```
When [situation/context],
I want to [motivation/action],
so I can [expected outcome/benefit].
```

**Examples**:
- "When I'm preparing for a board meeting, I want to quickly generate a performance dashboard, so I can demonstrate marketing ROI without spending hours on manual reporting."
- "When I'm launching a new product, I want to identify the right influencers, so I can reach my target audience authentically without wasting budget on poor-fit partnerships."

## Job Mapping Canvas

### Core Functional Job
The primary task the customer is trying to complete.
- What are they trying to get done?
- What is the desired end state?

### Related Jobs
Adjacent tasks that happen before, during, or after the core job.
- What do they need to do BEFORE this job? (Pre-job)
- What happens DURING the job? (Execution)
- What do they need to do AFTER? (Post-job)

### Emotional Jobs
How the customer wants to FEEL during and after the job.
- Feel confident in their decisions
- Feel in control of outcomes
- Avoid feeling embarrassed or incompetent
- Feel respected by peers and leadership

### Social Jobs
How the customer wants to be PERCEIVED by others.
- Appear innovative / ahead of the curve
- Be seen as a reliable/competent leader
- Demonstrate expertise to their team
- Show value to their organization

## Outcome-Driven Innovation Scoring

For each job, identify desired outcomes and score them:

### Outcome Statement Format
```
[Direction] the [metric] of [outcome] when [context]
```

**Direction**: Minimize, maximize, reduce, increase, eliminate
**Examples**:
- "Minimize the time it takes to generate a campaign report"
- "Reduce the likelihood of launching an underperforming ad"
- "Maximize the accuracy of budget allocation decisions"

### Opportunity Score

For each outcome, survey customers on two questions (1-10 scale):
1. **Importance**: How important is this outcome to you?
2. **Satisfaction**: How satisfied are you with your current solution?

```
Opportunity Score = Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0)
```

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 15+ | **Underserved** — High importance, low satisfaction. Major opportunity. |
| 10-14 | **Appropriately served** — Importance roughly matches satisfaction |
| <10 | **Overserved** — Current solutions exceed expectations (low-priority) |

## Competing Solutions Analysis

For each job, map ALL ways customers currently get the job done:

| Solution Type | Example | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Direct competitor** | Competitor product | [What they do well] | [What they lack] |
| **Indirect competitor** | Different product, same job | [Why customers use it] | [Where it falls short] |
| **DIY/Manual** | Spreadsheets, manual process | Free, customizable | Time-consuming, error-prone |
| **Non-consumption** | Customer doesn't do the job at all | Zero cost/effort | Job goes unfinished |

### Key Insight
Your biggest competitor is often NOT another product in your category — it's the spreadsheet, the manual process, or doing nothing at all.

## Switch Interview Methodology

Interview customers who recently switched TO your product (or FROM your product):

### Four Forces of Progress

1. **Push**: What was wrong with the old way? (Dissatisfaction with current solution)
2. **Pull**: What attracted you to the new solution? (Appeal of new solution)
3. **Anxiety**: What concerns did you have about switching? (Fear of the new)
4. **Habit**: What made it hard to leave the old way? (Comfort with the old)

**Switching happens when**: Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

### Interview Questions
- "When did you first start thinking about finding a new solution?"
- "What specific event triggered you to start looking?"
- "What other options did you consider?"
- "What almost stopped you from switching?"
- "What do you miss about the old way?"
- "What surprised you about the new solution?"
