- **Example**: "The project management tool built for remote teams"

### Formula 3: Social Proof-First
- **Headline**: "Join [number]+ [audience] who [achieved outcome]"
- **Subheadline**: "[Product] is the #1 rated [category] for [use case]"
- **Example**: "Join 50,000+ marketers who automated their reporting"

### Formula 4: Pain-First

## Above-the-Fold Checklist

- [ ] Can a visitor understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Is the headline clear and specific (not clever/vague)?
- [ ] Does the subheadline support the headline with detail?
- [ ] Is there ONE clear CTA button visible without scrolling?
- [ ] Is the CTA button high-contrast and action-oriented?
- [ ] Is there a relevant hero image or product visual?
- [ ] Is the page free of navigation that could distract from the CTA?

## CTA Optimization

### CTA Copy Formula
```
[Action Verb] + [Value/Outcome] + [Optional: Time/Ease Qualifier]
```

**Examples**:
- "Start My Free Trial" (better than "Sign Up")
- "Get My Marketing Report" (better than "Download")
- "See Pricing Plans" (better than "Learn More")
- "Book a 15-Min Demo" (better than "Contact Us")

### CTA Button Best Practices
- High-contrast color (stands out from page background)
- Minimum 44px height for mobile tap targets
- White space around the button
- Repeat CTA at top and bottom of page (minimum)
- Consider adding sub-CTA text: "No credit card required" / "Free forever plan"

## Message Match Principles

The landing page must match the referral source:

| Source | Landing Page Must Match |
|--------|----------------------|
| Google Ad | Headline echoes ad headline, offer matches ad promise |
| Meta Ad | Visual style matches ad creative, copy continues the story |
| Email | Headline references email subject/offer |
| Organic search | H1 matches search intent (answer the query) |

**Mismatch = high bounce rate.** The visitor should feel they arrived at the right place immediately.
