# Social Content — Platform-by-Platform Guide

## LinkedIn

### Post Types & Performance
| Type | Avg Engagement | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Text-only (with line breaks) | High | Thought leadership, stories |
| Carousel (PDF document) | Very High | Frameworks, step-by-step, data |
| Poll | High | Engagement, research, conversation |
| Video (native) | Medium-High | Expert commentary, behind-scenes |
| Newsletter article | Medium | Long-form thought leadership |
| Image + text | Medium | Data visualizations, quotes |

### Hook Formulas for LinkedIn
1. **Bold claim**: "Most marketing teams waste 60% of their ad budget. Here's why:"
2. **Personal story**: "I was fired from my first marketing job. Best thing that ever happened."
3. **Contrarian take**: "Unpopular opinion: SEO is not dead. Your strategy is."
4. **Data drop**: "We analyzed 10,000 LinkedIn posts. Here's what gets engagement:"
5. **Question**: "What's the one metric you'd save if you could only track one?"

### Optimal Length: 1,200-1,500 characters. Use line breaks every 1-2 sentences. Hashtags: 3-5 relevant.

## Twitter/X

### Thread Structure
- **Tweet 1**: Hook + promise (what they'll learn)
- **Tweets 2-8**: One point per tweet, numbered
- **Final tweet**: Summary + CTA (follow, retweet, link)

### Engagement Tactics
- Reply to comments within first hour (boosts algorithm visibility)
- Quote tweet relevant industry conversations with a take
- Use polls for easy engagement
- Pin your best-performing tweet

### Hashtags: 1-2 maximum (more looks spammy on Twitter)
### Optimal length: 100-200 characters for single tweets (under max for retweet room)

## Instagram

### Feed vs Stories vs Reels Strategy
| Format | Purpose | Cadence |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Feed posts | Polished, evergreen brand content | 3-5/week |
| Stories | Behind-the-scenes, polls, daily engagement | Daily |
| Reels | Reach and discovery (algorithm-favored) | 3-5/week |

### Caption Formula
1. **Hook** (first line — shown before "...more"): Strong statement or question
2. **Value** (body): 3-5 tips, story, or insight
3. **CTA** (end): Ask a question, prompt saves/shares
4. **Hashtags** (after): 5-15 relevant hashtags

### Hashtag Tiers
| Tier | Volume | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Branded | Any | #YourBrandName |
| Community | 10K-100K posts | #MarketingTips |
| Industry | 100K-500K posts | #DigitalMarketing |
| Trending | 500K+ posts | #Marketing (use sparingly) |

Mix: 3-5 community + 3-5 industry + 1-2 branded + 1-2 trending

- Questions and polls drive comments
- User-generated content builds community
