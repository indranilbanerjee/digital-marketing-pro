## Vocabulary Guidelines

### Preferred Words (examples)
- "team" instead of "users" or "customers"
- "build" instead of "create" or "develop"
- "simple" instead of "easy" or "effortless"
- "learn" instead of "find out" or "discover"

### Avoided Words
- Jargon the audience won't understand
- Superlatives without proof ("best," "leading," "revolutionary")
- Corporate buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "paradigm")
- Words that competitors overuse (differentiate)

### This-Not-That Template

| We Say | We Don't Say | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| "Let's figure this out" | "Contact our support team" | We're collaborative, not corporate |
| "Here's what we know" | "According to our proprietary analysis" | We're transparent, not pretentious |
| "Try it free" | "Sign up for a complimentary trial" | We're direct, not verbose |
