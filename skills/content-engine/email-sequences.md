# Email Sequences — Templates & Frameworks

## Welcome Sequence (5-7 Emails)

| Email | Timing | Subject Line Pattern | Content Focus | CTA |
|-------|--------|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | Immediately | "Welcome to [Brand]! Here's what's next" | Thank, set expectations, deliver promised content | Activate/explore |
| 2 | Day 2 | "[First Name], here's your quick win" | Deliver immediate value, quick-start guide | Complete first action |
| 3 | Day 4 | "How [Customer] achieved [Result]" | Social proof, success story | Explore feature |
| 4 | Day 7 | "3 things most [role]s miss about [product]" | Education, tips, deeper features | Advanced feature |
| 5 | Day 10 | "Your personal roadmap to [outcome]" | Personalized next steps based on behavior | Book demo/upgrade |
| 6 | Day 14 | "[First Name], any questions?" | Address common objections, offer help | Reply or support |

## Cart Abandonment Sequence (3 Emails)

| Email | Timing | Approach | Subject Line |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 hour after | **Reminder** (no discount) — "Did you forget something?" | "Your cart is waiting" |
| 2 | 24 hours | **Social proof + urgency** — Show reviews, limited stock | "Others are loving [product] — still interested?" |
| 3 | 48-72 hours | **Incentive** (if margins allow) — Small discount or free shipping | "Here's 10% off to complete your order" |

### Escalation Logic
- If AOV > $100: Include phone/chat support option in email 2
- If product has limited stock: Emphasize scarcity in email 2
- If customer has purchased before: Skip discount, emphasize loyalty
- Never offer discount in email 1 (trains customers to abandon carts)

## Nurture Drip (Educational → Conversion)

| Email | Focus | Content Type | CTA |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | **Education** | Blog post, guide, or how-to | Read more |
| 2 | **Education** | Different angle on same topic | Download resource |
| 3 | **Value** | Framework, template, or tool | Use this tool |
| 4 | **Social proof** | Case study or customer story | See the full story |
| 5 | **Comparison** | How we compare to alternatives | View comparison |
| 6 | **Offer** | Demo, trial, consultation | Book/start/sign up |

**Cadence**: 3-5 days between emails. Exit sequence when recipient converts.

## Re-Engagement Sequence

| Email | Timing | Approach |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 30 days inactive | "We miss you — here's what's new" (new features, content) |
| 2 | 37 days | "Here's what you're missing" (value reminder + social proof) |
| 3 | 44 days | "[Name], one last thing" (final offer or exclusive content) |
| 4 | 60 days | "Should we part ways?" (unsubscribe option, sunset warning) |

**After email 4**: If no engagement, suppress from marketing emails for 90 days. Move to reactivation list.

## Email Copywriting Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
1. **Problem**: Identify the pain point
2. **Agitate**: Make them feel it (consequences of inaction)
3. **Solve**: Present your solution as the answer

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
1. **Attention**: Subject line + opening hook
2. **Interest**: Expand on the topic with relevant details
3. **Desire**: Show benefits, social proof, create wanting
4. **Action**: Clear, single CTA

### Before-After-Bridge
1. **Before**: Current state (with their problem)
2. **After**: Desired state (problem solved)
3. **Bridge**: Your product/service is how they get there
