### B2B Ad Copy Principles
- Lead with the business outcome, not the product feature
- Reference the prospect's role or industry when possible
- Use specific numbers (dollar amounts, percentages, time saved)
- Professional tone but not corporate-speak
- Include clear next step (not just "Learn More" — try "Get the Report" or "See the ROI Calculator")

- Pattern interrupt: Start with something unexpected
- Text overlays > voiceover for first impression
- Feature a real person (creator-style > polished production)
- End with clear CTA on screen

## Ad Copy Testing Methodology

### Structured Variation Testing

Test one variable at a time:

| Test Priority | Variable | What to Test |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Hook / Opening** | Different first lines or first 3 seconds |
| 2 | **Value proposition** | Different benefits (save time vs save money vs reduce risk) |
| 3 | **Social proof type** | Numbers vs names vs testimonials vs awards |
| 4 | **CTA** | Different action verbs and urgency levels |
| 5 | **Offer** | Free trial vs demo vs discount vs content download |
| 6 | **Format** | Video vs static vs carousel |

### Minimum Test Duration
- Run each variation for at least 3-5 days
- Need minimum 100 clicks per variation for reliable CTR data
- Need minimum 30 conversions per variation for reliable CPA data
