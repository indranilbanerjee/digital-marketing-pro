## Social Storefront Best Practices

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Curate, don't dump** | Feature 20-50 hero products, not your entire 5,000-SKU catalog |
| **Collection strategy** | Organize by use case/occasion, not just category |
| **Seasonal rotation** | Update featured collections monthly or with seasons |
| **Social-native imagery** | Use lifestyle photos, UGC, and styled shots — not catalog white-background images |
| **Pricing transparency** | Show prices clearly; use "from $X" for variable pricing |
| **Reviews/ratings** | Display ratings where possible to build trust |
| **Cross-platform consistency** | Same products, pricing, and descriptions across all social storefronts |

---

## Analytics & Attribution

### Key Metrics by Platform

| Metric | Instagram | TikTok Shop | Facebook | Pinterest | YouTube |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Product views | Commerce Manager | Seller Center | Commerce Manager | Analytics | Merchant Center |
| Add to cart | Commerce Manager | Seller Center | Commerce Manager | N/A (redirect) | Merchant Center |
| Checkout initiated | Commerce Manager | Seller Center | Commerce Manager | N/A | Merchant Center |
| Purchases | Commerce Manager | Seller Center | Commerce Manager | Website analytics | Merchant Center |
| Revenue | Commerce Manager | Seller Center | Commerce Manager | Website analytics | Merchant Center |
| ROAS | Ads Manager | Ads Manager | Ads Manager | Ads Manager | Google Ads |

### Attribution Considerations
- Social commerce attribution is messy — users discover on social but may purchase later on website
- Use UTM parameters on all product links that redirect to website
- Implement platform pixels (Meta Pixel, TikTok Pixel, Pinterest Tag) for conversion tracking
- Track view-through conversions (users who saw product but purchased later)
- Consider incrementality testing to measure true lift from social commerce

## Influencer-Driven Commerce

### Commission Structure Benchmarks

| Influencer Tier | Follower Count | Typical Commission | Payment Model |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Nano | 1K-10K | 15-25% | Commission only |
| Micro | 10K-100K | 10-20% | Flat fee + commission |
| Mid-tier | 100K-500K | 8-15% | Flat fee + commission |
| Macro | 500K-1M | 5-12% | Flat fee + commission |
| Mega | 1M+ | 3-8% | Flat fee (primarily) |

### Influencer Commerce Tactics
1. **Affiliate storefronts** — Give creators their own curated shop page (LTK, Amazon Storefront, TikTok Affiliate)
2. **Discount codes** — Unique codes for tracking and incentivizing purchases
3. **Live shopping collaborations** — Co-host live streams with influencers
4. **Product seeding** — Send products for organic content (no obligation, high authenticity)
5. **Co-created products** — Collaborate on limited editions (highest engagement and conversion)

> **Social commerce is not e-commerce with a social layer.** It is social media with a commerce layer. Content comes first. Discovery is organic. Purchase is frictionless. The brands that win treat their social storefronts as entertainment destinations, not product catalogs.
