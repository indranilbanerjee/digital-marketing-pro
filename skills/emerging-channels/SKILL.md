## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /dm:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Process

### New Channel Evaluation (Most Common Use Case)

1. **Audience validation** -- Confirm the target audience is active on the channel in question. Check platform demographics, usage data, and competitor presence. Do not invest in a channel because it is trendy; invest because the audience is there.
2. **Competitive landscape** -- Analyze what competitors and adjacent brands are doing on the channel. Identify gaps and opportunities. Determine if there is a first-mover advantage or if the channel is already saturated.
3. **Resource assessment** -- Determine the minimum viable investment (time, budget, content production) required to test the channel meaningfully. Most emerging channels require consistent effort over 3-6 months before yielding reliable data.
4. **Pilot design** -- Create a 90-day pilot plan with specific content cadence, engagement strategy, and success metrics. Define what "success" looks like at the end of the pilot to make a continue/stop/scale decision.
5. **Content strategy** -- Develop channel-specific content that respects platform norms and user expectations. Repurpose existing content where possible, but always adapt to the platform format rather than cross-posting identical content.
6. **Measurement framework** -- Set up tracking for both leading indicators (followers, engagement, reach) and lagging indicators (website traffic, leads, sales) attributed to the channel.
7. **Execute and learn** -- Run the pilot, document what works and what doesn't, adjust the strategy based on data, and make the continue/stop/scale decision at the end of the pilot period.
8. **Scale or sunset** -- If the pilot succeeds, build a sustained strategy with increased resources. If it fails, document the learnings, sunset the effort, and redirect resources.

### Social Commerce Setup

1. **Platform selection** -- Choose the social commerce platform(s) based on audience presence, product type, and technical requirements. Visual products thrive on Instagram and Pinterest. Trend-driven products thrive on TikTok. Considered purchases benefit from YouTube.
2. **Storefront setup** -- Configure the platform's shopping features: product catalog upload, collection organization, shipping and return policies, and payment integration.
3. **Product content optimization** -- Create product listings optimized for social context. Social product descriptions should be shorter, more conversational, and benefit-focused compared to website listings. Product images should match the platform's visual style.
4. **Shoppable content strategy** -- Plan the content calendar with a mix of shoppable and non-shoppable content. Aim for a ratio where no more than 30-40% of content is directly shoppable to avoid audience fatigue.
5. **Live shopping integration** -- If applicable, plan live shopping events with hosts, products, and promotional cadence. Schedule during peak audience activity hours.
6. **Measurement setup** -- Configure platform analytics, UTM tracking for external attribution, and revenue tracking per platform and content type.

## Edge Cases

### Platform-Restricted Industries
Cannabis, CBD, firearms, adult products, and certain pharmaceutical products cannot advertise on most platforms and face restrictions on social commerce features. For these industries, focus on owned channels (website, email, SMS with compliance), community building on platforms that permit the category, SEO and content marketing, and compliant influencer partnerships. Always verify current platform policies as they change frequently.

### B2B Community Building
B2B communities operate differently from B2C. Members join for professional development, networking, and problem-solving rather than brand fandom. Slack and LinkedIn Groups tend to outperform Discord for B2B. Content should be practitioner-focused, not promotional. The community must deliver professional value independent of the product. Moderation is typically lighter but quality standards are higher.

### Podcast Measurement Limitations
Podcast attribution remains challenging. Downloads do not equal listens. Listener demographics are estimated, not measured. Cross-device tracking is unreliable. Mitigate by using unique promo codes, vanity URLs, and post-purchase surveys ("How did you hear about us?"). Accept that podcast marketing is often a brand/awareness investment with indirect attribution. Do not hold podcasts to the same direct-response metrics as paid search.

### Voice Search for Non-English Languages
Voice search optimization for non-English languages requires language-specific considerations. Natural language patterns, question structures, and colloquial expressions vary by language and dialect. Schema markup should use hreflang tags and language-specific structured data. Voice assistant capabilities and market penetration vary by language and region (Google Assistant vs Alexa vs Siri market share differs significantly by country).

### Social Commerce in Non-US Markets
In China, WeChat Mini Programs and Douyin (Chinese TikTok) dominate social commerce with capabilities far beyond Western platforms. In Southeast Asia, LINE and Shopee Live are major channels. In Korea, KakaoTalk commerce is significant. Do not assume Instagram and TikTok Shop are the default everywhere. Research market-specific platforms and behaviors before building a social commerce strategy for international markets.

### Community Toxicity Management
Even well-managed communities face toxicity challenges. Build clear community guidelines before launching, not after problems arise. Implement graduated enforcement (warning, temporary mute, temporary ban, permanent ban). Use AI moderation for first-pass filtering combined with human review for context-dependent decisions. Establish an appeals process. Document and respond to patterns (coordinated harassment, hate speech, misinformation) with transparent policy enforcement. Burnout among community managers is a real risk; plan for adequate staffing and rotation.
