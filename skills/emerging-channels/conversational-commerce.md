### Chatbot Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Identify the bot** | Always disclose that the user is chatting with a bot, not a human |
| **Limit scope** | Define 5-10 core intents the bot handles well; escalate everything else |
| **Provide human escalation** | "Talk to a human" option available at every step |
| **Use quick replies** | Offer button options to guide the conversation (reduce free-text friction) |
| **Handle dead ends** | Every unrecognized input gets a graceful fallback ("I didn't quite get that. Here are some things I can help with:") |
| **Personalize** | Use customer name, order history, browsing context when available |
| **Keep it short** | Messages under 60 words; break long responses into multiple messages |
| **Confirm actions** | Always confirm before processing orders, bookings, or account changes |

### Chatbot Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | AI Capability | Channels Supported | Pricing |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **ManyChat** | SMBs, e-commerce | Rule-based + AI | Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, SMS | Free tier + $15+/mo |
| **Intercom** | SaaS, support | AI (Fin) + rules | Web chat, email, Messenger, WhatsApp | $74+/mo |
