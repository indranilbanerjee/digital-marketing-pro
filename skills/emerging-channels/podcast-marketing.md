## Branded Podcast Launch Guide

### Pre-Production Planning

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Format** | Interview, solo/monologue, co-hosted, narrative/storytelling, panel, hybrid | Interview is easiest to launch; narrative has highest production value |
| **Length** | Short (10-20 min), Medium (20-40 min), Long (40-60+ min) | 25-35 minutes is the sweet spot for most business podcasts |
| **Frequency** | Weekly, biweekly, monthly, season-based | Weekly builds the fastest audience; biweekly is sustainable |
| **Season structure** | Evergreen (ongoing) or seasonal (8-12 episodes per season) | Seasonal reduces burnout and allows promotion windows |
| **Host** | CEO/founder, subject matter expert, hired host, rotating hosts | Choose someone with genuine enthusiasm and conversational ability |
| **Audience** | Existing customers, prospects, industry peers, general public | Define one primary persona — do not try to serve everyone |

### Production Tiers

| Tier | Equipment | Editing | Cost Estimate |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Tier 1 — Minimal** | USB microphone ($50-100), GarageBand/Audacity, Riverside.fm or Zencastr for remote | Self-edited, basic cleanup | $100-300 one-time + hosting |
| **Tier 2 — Semi-Pro** | XLR microphone ($150-300), audio interface ($100-200), Descript or Adobe Podcast for editing | Self or contractor editing, intro/outro music, show notes | $500-1,000 setup + $200-500/episode |
| **Tier 3 — Full Production** | Professional studio or studio-quality home setup, dedicated producer, sound designer | Full production: scripting, editing, sound design, mixing, mastering | $2,000-10,000+/episode |

## Podcast Advertising

### Ad Format Comparison

| **Produced/announcer** | Pre-produced ad spot, not read by host | $15-25 | Medium | Medium |
| **Programmatic** | Automated ad insertion based on listener data | $10-20 | Lower | Higher |

### Ad Placement Positions

|----------|------|--------------------|---------|
| **Pre-roll** | Before episode content (15-30 seconds) | Base rate | Brand awareness, short messages |
| **Mid-roll** | During episode content (60-90 seconds) | 1.5-2x premium | Detailed messaging, conversion |
| **Post-roll** | After episode content (15-30 seconds) | 0.5-0.7x discount | Reinforcement, lower-priority offers |

### CPM Benchmarks by Category

| News / Politics | $20-35 | Highly engaged, older skew |
| Sports | $18-30 | Passionate, predictable demo |
| Niche / Industry-specific | $30-50+ | Small but hyper-targeted audience |

### Podcast Ad Buying Process

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Define target audience | Demo, interests, job titles, listening habits |
| 2 | Identify candidate shows | Use Chartable, Podchaser, Listen Notes, or work with a podcast network |
| 3 | Request media kit | Audience size, demographics, engagement metrics, pricing |
| 4 | Negotiate terms | CPM vs. flat rate, minimum commitment, exclusivity, tracking |
| 5 | Provide ad copy/talking points | For host-read: bullet points and key messages (not a rigid script) |
| 6 | Set up tracking | Vanity URL, promo code, pixel-based attribution (Podsights, Chartable) |
| 7 | Launch and monitor | Track downloads, conversions, promo code redemptions |
| 8 | Optimize | Scale winning shows, pause underperformers, test new shows |

## Interview Format Guide

### Pre-Interview

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| Research guest | Read their recent work, listen to other podcast appearances, note unique angles |
| Send prep document | Share 5-8 topic areas (not exact questions) so guest can prepare but not script |
| Technical check | Test recording setup, internet, audio quality 15 minutes before |
| Set expectations | Duration, format, editing policy, release timeline |

### Interview Structure (30-45 minutes)

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| Warm-up | 2-3 min | Casual conversation (recorded but can be trimmed) |
| Introduction | 1-2 min | Host introduces guest and frames the topic |
| Background | 3-5 min | Guest's story, credentials, how they got here |
| Core content | 15-25 min | Main topic exploration, 3-5 key questions, follow-ups |
| Tactical advice | 5-7 min | Actionable takeaways, specific advice for listeners |
| Rapid fire / fun | 2-3 min | Lighter questions, recommendations, unpopular opinions |
| Close | 1-2 min | Where to find guest, CTA, teaser for next episode |

### Interviewing Best Practices
1. **Listen more than you talk.** The 80/20 rule: guest talks 80%, host 20%
2. **Ask follow-up questions.** The best insights come from "Tell me more about that"
3. **Avoid yes/no questions.** Start with "How," "Why," "What was it like when..."
4. **Be comfortable with silence.** Pause after their answer — they often add the best part
5. **Have a conversation, not an interrogation.** React naturally, share brief relevant anecdotes
